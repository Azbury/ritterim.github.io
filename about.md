## About Us

Ritter Insurance Marketing (RIM) is a Field Marketing Organization (FMO) in the Senior Life and Health Insurance markets. That means we promote and distribute insurance carriersâ€™ products to licensed agents.

RIMdev develops the tools to facilitate the success of these agents, helping them succeed and better support their clients.

We continue to develop a suite of RIM software products, eBroker Software's Quote-engine, and medicareful.com while contributing to support Open-Source Software initiatives and speaking.
