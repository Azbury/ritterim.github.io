Egg Fried Rice is a very homely dish in China. Every Chinese family make their fried rice differently, so you don't actually need a recipe to make fried rice, you can add whatever you want to the dish. Today, I am going to show you my method to make this simple, quick, and delicious dish.

## Ingredients
- 400g cooked rice (For two) - I use `Nishiki Medium Grain Rice` (https://www.amazon.com/Nishiki-Medium-Grain-Rice-Pound/dp/B00852ZN2U/ref=sr_1_8_s_it?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1543877113&sr=1-8&keywords=rice)
- soybean oil, vegetable oil, or peanut oil
- 3 eggs
- half onion (Chopped)
- 80 gram luncheon meat / any other meats
- corns and green peas
- 1/2 tbp salt
- 1/2 tbp sugar
- 3/4 tbp white pepper powder
- 4 Thai Pepper (Only if you like spicy)
- scallion for garnish


## Tips
- In order to make the best egg fried rice, I suggest you use leftover rice but you could make rice fresh but make sure to refrigerate it for at least 2 hours.
## DIRECTIONS:
- Chop all the ingredients into small pieces.
- In a working pan, heat oil on high heat. Saute the onion and the optional Thai Pepper until they start to soften, add the luncheon meat, corns and green peas, saute them for 3 mins. Once done, Put them in a separate dish. We will use them later.
- Put cooked rice into a Mixing Bowl, add eggs one by one. Mix the rice with the egg yolks, make sure all the rice grain are separate.
- In a working pan, heat oil on high heat. Add the rice, saute it until the egg is cooked, add all the ingredients, season with salt, sugar, and white pepper. Mix well with all the ingredients, and you can add more salt and pepper to adjust seasoning.
- Finally, garnish with sliced green scallion. Then The Golden Fried Rice is ready.

## Bottom Line

*First we eat, then we do everything else.*
