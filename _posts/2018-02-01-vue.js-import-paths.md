In today’s front-end ecosystem we are breaking down code into separate files and importing them. This helps us separate out code and reuse it more effectively. Vue does this in components similar to the way React does it. We have been using Vue in our projects lately and we love it so far because it’s progressive in nature. We can plug it into existing applications and add new features while giving the user a smoother experience, to creating full blown SPAs with it. We have run into a few snags, not completely the fault of Vue. Importing components from obscure locations is something that has been around for some time. Dealing with relative paths is not a problem for smaller projects but can become an issue as the project grows. With a little tweaking to webpack file we can implement a “root path” into our Vue applications. 

## The Situation
When you need to import a component that is three or four directories away. For example,
```
-src
  - Calendar
    - Components
      -Day.vue (current)
    - CalendarComponent.vue
  - Filters
    - DateConverstion.js
```
To import `DateConverstion.js` in the Day.vue component would include the import like the line below,
`import TimeConverstion from ‘../../Filters/ DateConverstion.js’`

## Solution
We are going to use Vue vue-cli tools to generate a web app. This way we have a folder structure that is standard for everyone. After you are done with your setup the folder structure should look similar too,
![Vue Cli Folder Structure](/images/vue-cli-folder-structure.png)

In the `build/webpack.conf.js` folder we are going to find the `resolve` object and add 
```
modules: [
      path.resolve('./src'),
      path.resolve('./node_modules')
    ]
```
The first array is where we are going to set the “root path”. I chose the src folder because by default this is where our application lives. If you change this for your own development reason remember to update it here. By doing this using the folder structure before we can now import  
`Filters/ DateConversation.js`

This can clean up our code as the application continues to grow and reduces less mistakes when trying to import long relative paths. This doesn’t remove the option for relative path imports too, so now we have the best of both worlds.
